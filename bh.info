     bh 0.1.0, Feb 26, 2018

     Eric Haberstroh

     Copyright © 2018, Eric Haberstroh

bh is an interactive accounting utility program.  It provides tools to
keep a list of accounts that can be searched through easily; it helps
convert amounts between net and gross value; it allows for easy
splitting of large bills between multiple invoicing parties.  All of
these facilities are available through an easy-to-discover interactive
command-line interface.  bh also allows to execute commands from
batchfiles, making it fully scriptable for repeating tasks.

This manual refers to version 0.1.0 of bh.  Watch the public repository
at ‘https://github.com/pille1842/bh’ for new releases of this program.
Feel free to report any bugs.  Pull requests and requests for feature
additions are also welcome!

1 Installation Guide
********************

This chapter will guide you through the installation of bh on your
machine.

* Menu:

* Requirements:: 
* Downloading bh:: 
* Installing on the system:: 
* Building HTML documentation:: 


File: bh.info,  Node: Requirements,  Next: Downloading bh,  Up: Installation Guide

1.1 Requirements
================

bh is written in Python 3.  In order to install it on your machine,
first make sure that the following requirements are satisfied:

   * Python 3.5+

   * prompt_toolkit(1) 1.0

   * Pygments(2) 2.2

You can install the required Python packages via pip.  On an Ubuntu
16.04 system, the following command will install these packages
globally:

     $ sudo -H pip3 install prompt_toolkit pygments

bh expects the Python interpreter to be named ‘python3’ on your system.
If it is not, you will need to change the first line of the program
accordingly, or make a symbolic link on your system that points to the
real Python interpreter.

File: bh.info,  Node: Downloading bh,  Next: Installing on the system,  Prev: Requirements,  Up: Installation Guide

1.2 Downloading bh
==================

In order to clone the bh repository locally, you will need to have Git
installed.  Clone the repository as follows:

     $ git clone https://github.com/pille1842/bh

You can also obtain a Zip archive by visiting the Releases page(1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

File: bh.info,  Node: Installing on the system,  Next: Building HTML documentation,  Prev: Downloading bh,  Up: Installation Guide

1.3 Installing on the system
============================

You can either run bh from the directory you downloaded it to, or you
can install it on your system globally.  bh comes with a Makefile that
allows you to use make to install bh.  Change into the directory you
downloaded bh into, then execute the following command to install the bh
program to ‘/usr/local/bin’:

     $ sudo make install

If you wish to install bh to another location, you can change the prefix
that is applied to the target path.  The default is ‘/usr/local’ to
comply with Linux filesystem standards.  In order to install bh into
‘/usr/bin’, run:

     $ sudo make PREFIX=/usr install

The install directive will also install the Linux manual page for bh and
the GNU Info manual into the appropriate locations.


File: bh.info,  Node: Building HTML documentation,  Prev: Installing on the system,  Up: Installation Guide

1.4 Building HTML documentation
===============================

If you wish to read HTML documentation offline, you will need Sphinx(1).
After installing it, go into the ‘doc/’ directory in the bh source, then
issue the following command:

     $ make html

This will build HTML documentation into ‘doc/_build/html/’.  Open
‘index.html’ with your browser to start reading.

2 The command-line interface
****************************

After installing bh, you can run it by typing ‘bh’ in a terminal window.
This will start bh in interactive mode.  You will be greeted by a short
license notice and a pointer towards the two most important commands:
‘help’ to display online help, and ‘quit’ to leave the program.

* Menu:

* The prompt:: 
* Getting help:: 
* Exiting bh:: 
* History:: 
* Issuing commands:: 


File: bh.info,  Node: The prompt,  Next: Getting help,  Up: The command-line interface

2.1 The prompt
==============

After that, a prompt will be displayed that looks like this:

     BH  0.00->

This prompt indicates a number of facts.  ‘0.00’ refers to the currently
set taxrate (see *note Working with taxrates: 10.).  The dash (‘-’)
indicates that there are no accounts in memory that have not been saved
to a file on disk (see *note The dirty bit: 11.).  If you change the
taxrate, the display will change accordingly.  If there are accounts in
memory that have not been saved to a file, this will be indicated by an
asterisk (*) instead of the dash.  If your terminal supports color, bh
will also color the prompt: the taxrate is printed yellow, while a dash
will be printed green and an asterisk red.


File: bh.info,  Node: Getting help,  Next: Exiting bh,  Prev: The prompt,  Up: The command-line interface

2.2 Getting help
================

bh has excellent online help built right into the interface.  Type
‘help’ to get a concise list of all commands ordered by general topic.
In order to get help for a specific command, type ‘help’ and then the
name of the command.  This will print a short usage information on how
to call the command as well as an explanation of what exactly each
command does.

The usage info uses standard POSIX syntax to describe different kinds of
arguments for commands.  Everything you should type into bh verbatim
will be printed in lower-case letters.  Anything you have to replace
with your own values will be printed in upper-case letters instead.  If
an argument is optional, meaning you do not have to supply it when
executing a command, it will be printed in square brackets ([]).  If you
can supply more than one argument of a certain type, this will be
indicated with three dots (…) after the argument name.


File: bh.info,  Node: Exiting bh,  Next: History,  Prev: Getting help,  Up: The command-line interface

2.3 Exiting bh
==============

You can quit bh either by typing ‘quit’ and hitting the Enter key, or by
hitting Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D. Please note that in the latter two cases, bh
will not warn you if there are any unsaved accounts in memory!  It is
best to always exit bh by issuing the ‘quit’ command.


File: bh.info,  Node: History,  Next: Issuing commands,  Prev: Exiting bh,  Up: The command-line interface

2.4 History
===========

All the usual Vi and Emacs keybindings that you might be familiar with
from your terminal emulator work in bh.  In particular, there is an
in-memory command history.  Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate
through previously executed commands.


File: bh.info,  Node: Issuing commands,  Prev: History,  Up: The command-line interface

2.5 Issuing commands
====================

To issue a command, first type the command, then a space, then any
arguments the command might require, separated by spaces.  If a single
argument needs to contain spaces, wrap it in double quotes (“) or espace
the space character with a backslash ().  If a command has no arguments,
typing the command name and hitting Enter is sufficient.

The command-line interface is fully compatible with POSIX shell
standards.  The way you issue commands to your shell is identical to the
way you issue commands to bh.


File: bh.info,  Node: Accounts,  Next: Working with taxrates,  Prev: The command-line interface,  Up: Top

3 Accounts
**********

bh helps you keep a list of accounts.  These might be the standard
accounts that are used in your jurisdiction, or user-defined accounts,
for example the accounts of your customers.  Each account has a unique
number and an associated name.  The list of accounts can easily be
searched through, stored on disk and loaded into bh.

It is important to note that bh is not an accounting program.  It does
not provide utilities to make entries into accounts, but simply to keep
a list of accounts that you can search through.  There are already
excellent accounting programs; bh is a utility program designed to help
in accounting where these programs might be lacking in speed and ease of
use.

* Searching the accounts list:: 
* Loading and saving accounts:: 
* Printing the accounts list:: 
* The dirty bit:: 


File: bh.info,  Node: Creating new accounts,  Next: Deleting accounts,  Up: Accounts

3.1 Creating new accounts
=========================

In order to create a new account, use the ‘newacc’ command.  It expects
two arguments: an account number and a name to give to the new account.
To create an account with number 1200 and the name “Bank Account”, issue
the following command to bh:

     BH> newacc 1200 "Bank Account"

Don’t forget to wrap arguments that contain spaces, like “Bank Account”,
into double quotes!

Notice how the prompt changed when you issued this command.  Instead of
a green dash, there will be a red asterisk.  This indicates that the
accounts list in memory contains an account that has not yet been saved
to a file on disk.

If you attempt to create an account with a number that already exists,
bh will refuse to do so.  This is not true when loading accounts from a
file on disk, however: In this case, accounts loaded later will
overwrite existing accounts if there is a collision, although bh will
issue a warning if it does overwrite an existing account.


File: bh.info,  Node: Deleting accounts,  Next: Searching the accounts list,  Prev: Creating new accounts,  Up: Accounts

3.2 Deleting accounts
=====================

To delete one or more accounts, simply pass their numbers as arguments
to the ‘delacc’ command:

     BH> delacc 1200 4200 4711

You can also clear the entire list of accounts with the ‘clearacc’
command.  bh will refuse to clear the list of accounts if there are
unsaved changes in the accounts list, however.


File: bh.info,  Node: Searching the accounts list,  Next: Loading and saving accounts,  Prev: Deleting accounts,  Up: Accounts

3.3 Searching the accounts list
===============================

There are two commands to search through the accounts list in memory:
‘acc’ and ‘accno’.  Use ‘acc’ to search through the names of accounts,
‘accno’ to search through their numbers.  Imagine you have the following
list of accounts:

     1200 TEST ACCOUNT
     4200 MY COMPANY, INC.
     4711 CUSTOMER ENTERPRISES CORP.

‘acc’ allows you to search for multiple terms at once.  This is example
output produced by issuing the following command:

     BH> acc test comp cust
     test:
       1200 TEST ACCOUNT
     comp:
       4200 MY COMPANY, INC.
     cust:
       4711 CUSTOMER ENTERPRISES CORP.

Search is case-insensitive and looks for parts of account names
regardless where they appear.  Use ‘accno’ to search for specific
account numbers instead:

     BH> accno 200 11
     200:
       4200 MY COMPANY, INC.
       1200 TEST ACCOUNT
     11:
       4711 CUSTOMER ENTERPRISES CORP.

‘accno’ looks for any part of an account number that matches a search
term.


File: bh.info,  Node: Loading and saving accounts,  Next: Printing the accounts list,  Prev: Searching the accounts list,  Up: Accounts

3.4 Loading and saving accounts
===============================

bh stores accounts on disk in JSON files.  Each such file contains an
object with key-value pairs.  The keys are account numbers while the
values represent account names.  You can save the accounts currently in
memory to a file with the ‘saveacc’ command:

     BH> saveacc myaccounts.json

This will also change the prompt again if there were unsaved accounts:
Instead of a red asterisk, it will now display a green dash, indicating
that all changes have been saved to disk.

To load accounts from one or more files, use the ‘loadacc’ command:

     BH> loadacc myaccounts.json otheraccounts.json

bh will warn you if any accounts in memory are overwritten due to an
identical account number read from a file.  It will also print the total
number of accounts read from each file.


File: bh.info,  Node: Printing the accounts list,  Next: The dirty bit,  Prev: Loading and saving accounts,  Up: Accounts

3.5 Printing the accounts list
==============================

Should you ever wish to print the entire list of accounts, you can do so
with the ‘pracc’ command.  It will sort the accounts by number and print
them.


File: bh.info,  Node: The dirty bit,  Prev: Printing the accounts list,  Up: Accounts

3.6 The dirty bit
=================

bh makes use of a so-called “dirty bit” to keep track of unsaved changes
to the accounts list.  Whenever you create a new account with the
‘newacc’ command, or delete an existing account with ‘delacc’, the dirty
bit is turned on.  This changes the prompt: It will now display a red
asterisk instead of a green dash.  Saving the accounts list to a file
with ‘saveacc’ will turn the dirty bit off and return the prompt to
normal.

If the dirty bit is turned on, this will also change the behaviour of
some commands.  ‘quit’ will refuse to exit if there are unsaved changes.
‘clearacc’ will not allow you to clear the entire list of accounts.

You can manually turn the dirty bit on and off with the ‘setdirty’
command:

     BH> setdirty 0

To turn the dirty bit on, use one of the following values as an argument
to ‘setdirty’: 1, true, yes, on, one.  To turn it off, use one of these
values: 0, false, no, off, zero.


File: bh.info,  Node: Working with taxrates,  Next: Calculations,  Prev: Accounts,  Up: Top

4 Working with taxrates
***********************

Most of the calculations done by bh include some sort of conversion
between net and gross values.  For this purpose, you can define a global
taxrate that is indicated as part of your command prompt:

     BH 19.00->

In this case, the taxrate is set to 19 percent.  The following commands
will alter their behaviour because of this setting:

‘gr’, ‘grsum’

     gr and grsum will use the taxrate to convert net amounts to gross
     values.

‘net’, ‘netsum’

     net and netsum will use the taxrate to convert gross amounts to net
     values.

‘split’

     split will convert any amounts given to it (except the total) to
     gross value if the taxrate is set to anything but zero.

* Menu:

* Setting the taxrate:: 
* Getting the current taxrate:: 


File: bh.info,  Node: Setting the taxrate,  Next: Getting the current taxrate,  Up: Working with taxrates

4.1 Setting the taxrate
=======================

You can set the global taxrate by using the ‘settaxr’ command:

     BH  0.00-> settaxr 19
     BH 19.00->

This will immediately be indicated in your command prompt.  Please note
that you can give a number with arbitrary precision to be set as the
taxrate, like 25.4711.  This will also be used in calculations.
However, neither the prompt nor the ‘prtaxr’ command will ever indicate
more than two decimal places!


File: bh.info,  Node: Getting the current taxrate,  Prev: Setting the taxrate,  Up: Working with taxrates

4.2 Getting the current taxrate
===============================

In addition to the prompt, you can also ask bh to print out the current
taxrate with the ‘prtaxr’ command:

     BH 19.00-> prtaxr
     Taxrate is set to 19.00 percent.

5 Calculations
**************

bh has a number of tools built in to help you with common calculations
you might need when doing your accounting work.  In particular, it can
easily convert between net and gross values and calculate totals.  There
is also a facility built right in that allows you to split a large bill
between multiple contributing parties.

* Menu:

* Converting net and gross values:: 
* Calculating totals:: 
* Splitting bills:: 


File: bh.info,  Node: Converting net and gross values,  Next: Calculating totals,  Up: Calculations

5.1 Converting net and gross values
===================================

After setting a taxrate (see *note Setting the taxrate: 28.), you can
convert amounts between net and gross value using the ‘net’ and ‘gr’
commands.  ‘net’ will convert any amounts you give it to net value,
while ‘gr’ does the opposite: It converts amounts to gross value:

     BH 19.00-> gr 350 700 121.12
       350.00: GROSS( 19.00%)   416.50
       700.00: GROSS( 19.00%)   833.00
       121.12: GROSS( 19.00%)   144.13
     BH 19.00-> net 416.5 833.00 144
       416.50: NET( 19.00%)   350.00
       833.00: NET( 19.00%)   700.00
       144.00: NET( 19.00%)   121.01

As you can see, each of these commands converts any amounts you give it
as arguments.  You have to give these commands at least one argument,
otherwise they will print out an error message.


File: bh.info,  Node: Calculating totals,  Next: Splitting bills,  Prev: Converting net and gross values,  Up: Calculations

5.2 Calculating totals
======================

There are three commands that calculate sums.  The ‘sum’ command simply
adds all the arguments it gets and prints out the total, rounded to two
decimal places.  The ‘grsum’ will do the same, but will treat any
amounts it gets as net value and convert them to gross value first.
Finally, the ‘netsum’ command treats all its arguments as gross value
and will convert them to net value first:

     BH 19.00-> sum 100 200 300
     TOTAL   600.00
     BH 19.00-> grsum 100 200 300
     TOTAL   714.00
     BH 19.00-> netsum 100 200 300
     TOTAL   504.20

Each of these commands also has an interactive mode.  Call them without
any arguments to use it:

     BH 19.00-> sum
     Amount (empty line to quit): 100
     Amount (empty line to quit): 200
     Amount (empty line to quit): 300
     Amount (empty line to quit):
     TOTAL   600.00

All three commands will ask you for further amounts until you quit with
an empty line of input.


File: bh.info,  Node: Splitting bills,  Prev: Calculating totals,  Up: Calculations

5.3 Splitting bills
===================

This is a very special facility built into bh.  It is suitable for the
following situation: Your company invoices a customer with a set gross
amount of, say, $1200.00.  In internal accounting, you want to split
this bill into accounts for multiple employees who contributed to the
billed work.  You know the net values each employee has contributed, but
you wish to convert them to gross value first before splitting the bill.

The ‘split’ command allows you to do exactly that.  It expects at least
two arguments: A total that is assumed to already be gross value, and
one net amount that will be converted to gross value and subtracted from
the total:

     BH 19.00-> split 1200 300 300
     TOTAL  1200.00
     PER01   357.00
     PER02   357.00
     REST    486.00

As you can see, if a rest remains, bh will also print that.  If the sum
of the amounts is larger than the total you have provided, this will be
indicated with a ‘!MISS’ line that informs you of the missing amount.
If no rest remains and nothing is missing, this will be indicated by a
line saying ‘EXACT’.

‘split’ also has an interactive mode.  Call it without any arguments to
use it:

     BH 19.00-> split
     Total: 1200
     Amount (empty line to quit): 300
     Amount (empty line to quit): 300
     Amount (empty line to quit):
     TOTAL  1200.00
     PER01   357.00
     PER02   357.00
     REST    486.00

‘split’ will continue to prompt you for further amounts to subtract
until you quit with an empty line of input.

6 Batch Processing
******************

bh allows you to execute commands from so-called batch files.  These are
files that contain commands, one per line, as you would issue them in an
interactive bh session.

Batch files can also contain comments.  A comment is something intended
for the human reader of a batch file, explaining what the purpose of the
commands that are being executed is.  bh will ignore comments.  You can
make any line a comment by starting it with a pound sign (#).  Please
note that inline comments are not allowed; each comment has to start at
the beginning of a line.

* Providing batch files as command line arguments:: 
* Using batch files as shell scripts:: 


File: bh.info,  Node: Executing batch files from within bh,  Next: Providing batch files as command line arguments,  Up: Batch Processing

6.1 Executing batch files from within bh
========================================

If at any point in a bh session you wish to execute commands from a
batch file, use the ‘exec’ command to do so:

     BH 19.00-> exec mybatchfile.bat

bh will then read the contents of the given file (relative to the
current working directory).  It will print out any commands it is about
to execute preceded with ‘BH>’.  Suppose your batch file has the
following contents:

     # This is a comment.
     settaxr 19
     grsum 100 200 300
     # Another comment. Let's split a bill!
     split 1200 300 300

Save this file as ‘example.bat’ and execute it from within bh.  The
output will be the following:

     BH  0.00-> exec example.bat
     BH> settaxr 19
     BH> grsum 100 200 300
     TOTAL   714.00
     BH> split 1200 300 300
     TOTAL  1200.00
     PER01   357.00
     PER02   357.00
     REST    486.00

As you can see, the comment lines have been ignored, and any commands
contained within the batch file have been printed out preceded by ‘BH>’
before being executed in the interactive session.


File: bh.info,  Node: Providing batch files as command line arguments,  Next: Using batch files as shell scripts,  Prev: Executing batch files from within bh,  Up: Batch Processing

6.2 Providing batch files as command line arguments
===================================================

You can also supply any number of batch files to be processed right at
the startup of bh by giving them as command line arguments to bh.  Type
the following into your shell to execute the ‘example.bat’ file from the
previous section:

     $ bh example.bat

bh will print its usual welcome message and then immediately execute the
batch file.  You can use this, for example, to load accounts from a file
and set a tex rate appropriate for your jurisdiction right when you are
about to start your accounting work.  You don’t have to type these
commands over and over again in each interactive session.

You could also define an alias in your shell to do this for you.
Suppose you simply want to type ‘accounting’ to start bh and execute the
‘example.bat’ file from the previous section.  You could add the
following to your ‘.bashrc’ or any of the other usual POSIX shell setup
files:

     alias accounting='bh ~/example.bat'

Note that in this case, an absolute path to your home directory was
supplied as an argument, not a path relative to the current working
directory.  For more information about aliases, see the Advanced
Bash-Scripting Guide(1).

File: bh.info,  Node: Using batch files as shell scripts,  Prev: Providing batch files as command line arguments,  Up: Batch Processing

6.3 Using batch files as shell scripts
======================================

UNIX systems allow you to define any command interpreter at the
beginning of a script file.  You can use this to your advantage.  Edit
your ‘example.bat’ file to look like this:

     #!/usr/local/bin/bh
     # This is a comment
     settaxr 19
     grsum 100 200 300
     split 1200 300 300

Then, make the file executable by changing its permissions from within
your shell:

     $ chmod +x example.bat

Now you can start bh and execute any commands from the batch file by
simply typing the following into your shell:

7.1 0. PREAMBLE
===============

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to assure
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be
used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
published as a printed book.  We recommend this License principally for
works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


File: bh.info,  Node: 1 APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS,  Next: 2 VERBATIM COPYING,  Prev: 0 PREAMBLE,  Up: GNU Free Documentation License

7.2 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
====================================

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below, refers
to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and
is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you copy, modify or
distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License.  If a section
does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero Invariant
Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
there are none.

The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may be at
most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly
with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor,
and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy
that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats
which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.

The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.

7.3 2. VERBATIM COPYING
=======================

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


File: bh.info,  Node: 3 COPYING IN QUANTITY,  Next: 4 MODIFICATIONS,  Prev: 2 VERBATIM COPYING,  Up: GNU Free Documentation License

7.4 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
==========================

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
computer-network location from which the general network-using public
has access to download using public-standard network protocols a
complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If
you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


File: bh.info,  Node: 4 MODIFICATIONS,  Next: 5 COMBINING DOCUMENTS,  Prev: 3 COPYING IN QUANTITY,  Up: GNU Free Documentation License

7.5 4. MODIFICATIONS
====================

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the list of
Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice.  These
titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for
example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover
Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text
for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by
the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


File: bh.info,  Node: 5 COMBINING DOCUMENTS,  Next: 6 COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS,  Prev: 4 MODIFICATIONS,  Up: GNU Free Documentation License

7.6 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
==========================

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.  Make the
same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in
the various original documents, forming one section Entitled “History”;
likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any
sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all sections Entitled
“Endorsements”.


File: bh.info,  Node: 6 COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS,  Next: 7 AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS,  Prev: 5 COMBINING DOCUMENTS,  Up: GNU Free Documentation License

7.7 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
===============================

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


File: bh.info,  Node: 7 AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS,  Next: 8 TRANSLATION,  Prev: 6 COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS,  Up: GNU Free Documentation License

7.8 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
=========================================

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright resulting
from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.  When the
Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works
of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers
that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.  Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.


File: bh.info,  Node: 8 TRANSLATION,  Next: 9 TERMINATION,  Prev: 7 AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS,  Up: GNU Free Documentation License

7.9 8. TRANSLATION
==================

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.  Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
Invariant Sections.  You may include a translation of this License, and
all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
provided that you also include the original English version of this
License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In
case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.


File: bh.info,  Node: 9 TERMINATION,  Next: 10 FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE,  Prev: 8 TRANSLATION,  Up: GNU Free Documentation License

7.10 9. TERMINATION
===================

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to
copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


File: bh.info,  Node: 10 FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE,  Prev: 9 TERMINATION,  Up: GNU Free Documentation License

7.11 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
=========================================

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<‘https://www.gnu.org/licenses/’>.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies
that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be
used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.  11.
RELICENSING

“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any World
Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides
prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A public wiki
that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A “Massive
Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site means any
set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
