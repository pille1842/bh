Welcome to bh's documentation!
==============================

bh is an interactive accounting utility program. It provides tools to keep a
list of accounts that can be searched through easily; it helps convert amounts
between net and gross value; it allows for easy splitting of large bills between
multiple invoicing parties. All of these facilities are available through an
easy-to-discover interactive command-line interface. bh also allows to execute
commands from batchfiles, making it fully scriptable for repeating tasks.

This manual refers to version 0.1.0 of bh. Watch the public repository at
https://github.com/pille1842/bh for new releases of this program. Feel free to
report any bugs. Pull requests and requests for feature additions are also
welcome!
